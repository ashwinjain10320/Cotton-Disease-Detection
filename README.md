# Cotton-Disease-Detection

This Deep Learning Model is built using Tensorflow-Keras in this we made use of Transfer Learning's architecture Inception V3, this web application classify images of the diseased cotton leaf,fresh cotton leaf,diseased cotton plant and fresh cotton plant.During creating a perfect model we have trained this Cotton Leaf Image Dataset with Different Transfer Learning Architectures.Our model performs fairly good over 20 epochs with an Validation Accuracy of 0.97 on a batch size of 32.This provides a handy tool to utilize the power of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Image Classification Problems where time and accuracy is the paramount objective of classification.

## Some samples of images being used for model training and validation
